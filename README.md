## Contents of the Repo
This repo contains the code required to generate the landing page for the capstone project.

The landing page is viewable [here](http://bchong.me/info-capstone-2020/).

## Building the Repo (with Yarn dependency manager)
1. Clone the repo to your local machine (`git clone <REPO URL>`).
2. Change directory into the cloned repo's client folder (`cd <REPO NAME>/client`).
3. Run the terminal command `yarn` to install dependencies.
4. Once all dependencies are successfully installed, run `yarn run dev` to build assets.
5. Once all build files have been built, run `yarn start` to host the webpage locally.

The landing page should now be hosted on http://localhost:3000 (or a different port if 3000 is already in use).

## Deploying updates to Github pages
1. Make sure you have writing permissions to the repo.
2. Make sure you have installed all dependencies via `yarn`.
3. Run `yarn run deploy`.
4. Check http://bchong.me/info-capstone-2020/ for your updates. If your updates are not showing, please wait a few minutes. If changes still don't show, please contact Brandon (bch0ng).
