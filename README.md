## Contents of the Repo

This repo contains the code required to generate the landing page for the capstone project.

The landing page is viewable [here](http://bchong.me/info-capstone-2020/).



## Building the Repo (with Yarn dependency manager)
1. Clone the repo to your local machine (`git clone <REPO URL>`).
2. Change directory into the cloned repo's client folder (`cd <REPO NAME>/client`).
3. Run the terminal command `bundle install` to install gems.
4. Once all gems are successfully installed, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to host the webpage locally.

The landing page should now be hosted on http://127.0.0.1:4000.



## Deploying updates to Github pages
1. Push changes to `gh-pages` branch.
4. Check http://bchong.me/info-capstone-2020/ for your updates. If your updates are not showing, please wait a few minutes. If changes still don't show, please contact Brandon (bch0ng).
