###	The Oregon Nature Conservancy needs better data management to protect nature.

The Oregon chapter of The Nature Conservancy does important work in conservation, land management and public outreach. With such broad interests, the Nature Conservancy accumulates terabytes of data a year in documents, GIS and promotional resources. This mass of data has been accumulating over the years creating unnecessary disorganization and unproductivity within the branch. Our agenda is to streamline their data organization to help improve efficiency and protect nature.

## Solution

In progress.
